L5 — Safety Gateway

Responsibilities:
    • Serve as the primary enforcement point for safety and policy checks.
    • Evaluate intents and outputs from lower layers before execution or release.
    • Route escalations to constitutional and policy engines without duplicating their logic.

Produces StatePatch outputs only.
